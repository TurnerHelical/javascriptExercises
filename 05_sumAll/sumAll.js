// Function that takes 2 given numbers and adds all the numbers between
// them into aa final sum
    // Create variable to hold the final sum
    // Needs to loop through all the numbers between the given numbers
    // and add them up and store in the final sum
    // The final sum needs to be returned


// EX: 2,6 needs to loop starting from 2 and add 3 then store that value
// in the final sum
// then 3 + 4 and store that value in the final Sum
// then 4 + 5 and store in final sum
// then 5 + 6 and store in final sum
// then the final sum needs to be returned
